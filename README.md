### The Problem:
Roads are an important mode of transport in India. India has one of the largest road networks in the world, with about 59 lakh km of road length. With such a large network of roads in India, Potholes have become a major problem. There has been a significant increase in accidents that occur on the road because of these Potholes and road safety is very less, since these life-threatening potholes never get filled. The risk of vehicular damage is also a concern. All this is because the government failed to maintain and repair roads. People tend to just live with these potholes, instead of reporting it.

### Our Solution:
An online platform can be developed where the masses can easily visualize and contribute to lowering the rate of these potholes. Here, people can easily report potholes, in a few simple steps and earn rewards for the same. While Google Maps has drastically improved in charting Indian roads, it still doesnâ€™t have information about dents and potholes in the road, neither does it provide you with a feature to report these problems directly to the government. This is what Beton is trying to overcome.
